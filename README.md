# Driver Drowsiness Detection System

A real-time system to detect driver drowsiness using **OpenCV**, **Keras**, and **Pygame**. It monitors eye states (open/closed) and triggers an alarm when drowsiness is detected.

## Features
- Real-time face and eye detection using Haar Cascade classifiers.
- Eye state prediction (Open/Closed) with a pre-trained CNN model.
- Audio alarm to alert the driver during prolonged eye closure.

## Usage
1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python drowsiness_detection.py
2. Press q to exit the program.
